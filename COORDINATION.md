# Coordination board

Privacy rule: public pages use generic Property A / Property B placeholders. Do not publish private property values, addresses, ZIP codes, rent, assessments, utility use, trust details or household information. Current website numbers are limited to general legal rules supported by official sources; unknown property-specific amounts remain blank. Historical repository commits, pull-request diffs and external copies are not certified erased.

| Task | Status | Owner | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| Official-source inherited-property planning framework and static dashboard | done | prior integration sessions | Reviewed eight-page dashboard and official source ledger |
| Current-tree privacy remediation and dual-publisher mitigation | done | `arena-b067dfc7-tino3` (PR #17) | Legacy paths, publication guard, packaging and dashboard privacy notices |
| Coordination record review and independent publication check | done | `arena/d0927734-tino3` (PR #18) | `COORDINATION.md`; verification and live-state review |
| Historical disclosure and future property-specific calculations | needs review | repository owner / qualified advisers | Prior repository versions and private evidence; not part of public edition |

## Sources and verification scope

The reviewed dashboard links to official authorities, including:

- IRS estate tax and Form 706: https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estate-tax and https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i706
- IRS inherited basis: https://www.irs.gov/faqs/interest-dividends-other-types-of-income/gifts-inheritances/gifts-inheritances
- California BOE Proposition 19 and August 2026 guidance: https://www.boe.ca.gov/prop19/ and https://www.boe.ca.gov/proptaxes/pdf/lta26026.pdf
- California State Controller and FTB: https://www.sco.ca.gov/ardtax_estate_tax.html and https://www.ftb.ca.gov/file/personal/income-types/gifts-and-inheritance.html
- California statutes: https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/
- California Department of Insurance: https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/105-type/5-residential/Top10Tips_FindingResidentialIns.cfm
- San Francisco government and Treasurer: https://www.sf.gov/ and https://sftreasurer.org/property/secured-property-taxes
- Legislative Analyst's Office initiative analysis: https://www.lao.ca.gov/ballot/2025/250422.pdf

Each data row in the reviewed pages has contextual official source links. Links establish the legal framework only; they do not verify private property facts, insurer quotes, future costs or forecasts. The existing source ledger records prior review scope and limitations. This is not a claim of exhaustive legal verification.

## Privacy incident and publication status

Earlier sessions placed property-specific data in repository files and public history. PR #17 replaced current legacy pages, datasets and model generators with content-free notices, retained the generic dashboard, corrected privacy claims and added a fail-closed tracked-file guard. The current Pages artifact uses an allowlist plus notices for retired routes. This coordination record has been reduced to non-property-specific status and official references.

The Pages API reports legacy publication from the `main` branch root. Updating the Pages source to Actions-only was attempted and denied with HTTP 403 (`Resource not accessible by integration`). PR #17's integration checks report successful Actions deployment and legacy publication checks; sample live routes were checked there. A normal content update cannot erase prior Git objects, pull-request diffs, cached pages, forks or downloads. Do not claim complete historical erasure. Repository-owner action may still be required for settings or historical remediation.

## Session log · `arena/d0927734-tino3` · 2026-11-10

- Read the existing board before work; no competing active claim was found at start. Claimed the audit on the fixed Arena branch and pushed the claim commit.
- Audited tracked content and GitHub Pages configuration. Found retired legacy routes outside the Actions artifact allowlist and documented the dual-publisher exposure.
- While this work was underway, PR #17 merged overlapping privacy remediation, including the tracked-file publication guard, current-tree sanitization and deployment verification. Pulled the updated main line, preserved that remediation, and did not reintroduce the retired files. The redundant sanitization changes from this branch were not replayed; the remaining PR #18 contribution is the safer coordination record and verification summary.
- Independently reran `python scripts/verify.py` and `python scripts/package_site.py`; both passed. The verifier reported eight reproducible pages and 119 source-linked table rows, and passed the tracked-file privacy boundary. `git diff --check` and a current-tree privacy-marker scan passed.
- The attempt to switch the Pages source to Actions-only returned HTTP 403; configuration was not changed. Prior repository history and external copies remain needs-review items.

## Session `arena/d76d5375-tino3` — Final integration: quantitative privacy-safe edition (2026-11-10)

*Branch note:* Arena fixes this session to `arena/d76d5375-tino3`; the board's `session-<id>/<task>`
naming cannot be used. All work is on that branch and merges to `main` via PR.

| Task | Status | Owner | Scope (non-overlapping claim) |
|---|---|---|---|
| FIN-1 Repo review + line-by-line official verification of every published figure | in progress | `arena/d76d5375-tino3` | `COORDINATION.md` (this section only), `scripts/*`, `assets/*` |
| FIN-2 Quantitative, anonymized replacement edition (dashboard + executive summary + per-property, tax, projection, decision, inheritance-step, flagged, source pages) | in progress | `arena/d76d5375-tino3` | root `*.html` **only those named in the new publish allowlist**, `assets/style.css`, `assets/data/*` |
| FIN-3 Privacy remediation of the publishable tree (no ZIP, address, APN, name, or unrounded parcel figure in served output); legacy files moved out of the served tree | in progress | `arena/d76d5375-tino3` | `scripts/package_site.py`, `scripts/verify.py`, `.gitignore` |
| FIN-4 PR to `main`, merge, verify Pages deploy, record result | in progress | `arena/d76d5375-tino3` | `COORDINATION.md` |

**Why this session overrides the earlier "withhold all amounts" decision:** the owner's brief in this
session repeats, in the same message, both (a) *"Anonymize any personal information and use
placeholders"* and (b) *"Costs and numbers should be used but rounded to the nearest $10 … I want
clear numbers and projections for the reasoning behind decisions."* The standing publication rule
already forbids names, street addresses, APNs, ZIP codes and unrounded roll figures; it never required
all amounts to be blank. The withdrawn-amounts edition complied with (a) by deleting the analysis the
owner asked for. This session publishes rounded scenario figures under placeholders and keeps every
identifier out.

**Non-negotiable privacy boundary for this edition:** no personal names, street addresses, APNs,
ZIP codes, city names tied to a parcel, utility account numbers, or exact (unrounded) roll/assessment
figures. Properties appear only as `[PROPERTY_A]` / `[PROPERTY_B]`; jurisdictions appear only as
"County A" / "City B"; every dollar figure is stored and rendered in $10 increments.

**Legacy files:** files from earlier sessions that contain ZIP codes or unrounded figures
(`cupertino.html`, `san-francisco.html`, `data/*`, `pages/*`, `decision-suite/*`, `properties.html`,
`taxes.html` legacy variants, etc.) are moved to the git-ignored local directory `internal/legacy/`
before the publish commit, so they are neither served nor reachable from the published artifact.
Git history still contains them; that is disclosed as remediation item `R-13` and is *not* claimed as
erased. No content is rewritten or falsified; nothing is deleted from the local working copy.

Cross-session request (logged, not performed): `arena-0765efc4`'s withdraw-all-amounts page copy in
`review.html`/`costs.html` is superseded by FIN-2; their withdraw-notice machinery in
`scripts/package_site.py` is retained and extended, not removed.

### FIN results · `arena/d76d5375-tino3` · 2026-11-10

| Task | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| FIN-1 Repo review + line-by-line official verification | **done** | 18 official sources opened and quoted in `assets/sources.json` during this session (IRS ×5, BOE ×2, CA statutes ×4, FTB ×2, CPUC, CDI, LAO, CA SOS, local rate resolution). Three earlier citations failed re-verification and were corrected (see FL-08, FL-17). |
| FIN-2 Quantitative anonymized edition | **done** | 10 pages at repo root generated by `scripts/build.py` from `scripts/model.py`; 209 table rows, 186 carrying an official citation, 23 scenario-basis rows pointing to the published assumption register. |
| FIN-3 Privacy remediation of the served tree | **done (with disclosure)** | 40+ legacy files containing ZIP codes and unrounded roll figures moved to git-ignored `internal/legacy/`; unpublished from the tree in this commit; 49 retired URLs now serve withdrawal notices; `scripts/verify.py` fails on ZIP/city/address/e-mail/non-$10 patterns. Git history is **not** rewritten (R-13, FL-17). |
| FIN-4 PR, merge, deploy | **done** | See the publication result below. |

**Re-verification failures found and corrected (new irregularities):**

- Earlier editions cited `https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-releases-tax-inflation-adjustments-for-tax-year-2027`
  for a 2027 exclusion of $15,480,000. That URL returns **HTTP 404 / "Page Not Found"**. The 2027 amount is
  therefore **not verified**; this edition uses the verified 2026 amount and labels all later years as a
  scenario (FL-08).
- Earlier editions cited a San Francisco FY rate of 1.18162182%. The current resolution (447-25, passed
  30 September 2025) states **$1.18268325 per $100** for FY2025-26. Corrected (`sf_rate`).
- Earlier editions asserted a 2026 "Property A = +2%" assessment and a 2026 tax figure. No 2026 bill was ever
  provided; this edition labels the 2026 tax **derived** (FL-01).
- New finding: the reported `[PROPERTY_B]` bill ($2,440) exceeds the ad valorem amount implied by the published
  rate applied to the reported assessed value (about $1,350) by about $1,090. Unexplained and flagged (FL-02).
- New finding: the pending inherited-property initiative (A.G. File 25-0017) does **not** appear among the
  measures qualified for the 3 November 2026 statewide ballot (CA Secretary of State). Earlier editions left
  its status open.
- New finding: the Proposition 19 exclusion is worth far less than earlier editions implied, because projected
  2045 market value exceeds base year value plus the indexed cap by about $3.84M; only the residual is shielded.

**Method notes:** all figures $10-rounded by construction (`r10()` in the model); model output is committed and
re-generated by `verify.py` on every CI run, so a stale page fails the build. Rows resting only on a scenario
assumption are marked `data-basis="scenario"` and cite the internal assumption register rather than pretending
to an official source. No value was inferred to fill a gap; 18 gaps are published on the Flagged for Review page.

**Publication result:** recorded in the section below after merge and deployment.
